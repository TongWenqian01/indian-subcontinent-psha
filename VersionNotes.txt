Outstanding concerns from v0:

zoneid
17                               could be stable
169    only YCSH97 includes events to this depth
170    only YCSH97 includes events to this depth
172    only YCSH97 includes events to this depth
906               main thrust fault runs through
903                      oceanic not continental
915                      oceanic not continental
916                      oceanic not continental
917                      oceanic not continental
918                      oceanic not continental

Fixed in v1:
* major TRT and MSR reassignment with input from KKST
* focal mechanisms & seismicity for zones 169 and 170 swapped
* focal mechanism for zone 914 corrected from GCMT catalogue
* switched zones 12, 13, 63, 137, 929, 931 to secondary focal plane

Outstanding concerns with v1:
Zone 14 (Makran) is subduction interface but mechanism is strike-slip

TODO:
1. Map all zone focal mechanisms against those recomputed from GCMT catalogue
(1976-2008 and 1976-2017).
2. Summarize TRT and MSR reassignment.
