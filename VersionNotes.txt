Outstanding concerns since v0:
* zone 17: could be stable instead of active shallow
* zones 169, 170, 172: only YCSH97 includes events to this depth
* zones 903, 915, 916, 917, 918: oceanic not continental

Fixed in v1:
* major TRT and MSR reassignment with input from KKST
* focal mechanisms & seismicity for zones 169 and 170 swapped
* focal mechanism for zones 14 and 914 corrected from GCMT catalogue
* switched zones 12, 13, 63, 137, 929, 931 to secondary focal plane

Future work:
1. Summarize TRT and MSR assignment changes between v0 and v1.
2. Map all zone focal mechanisms against those recomputed from GCMT catalogue
(1976-2008 and 1976-2017). Identify zones with multiple modes in their moment
tensor distributions. Cross-reference against literature and USGS finite 
fault solutions to choose between focal planes. Determine whether the added 
complexity is worthwhile, and if so make this v2.
3. Model the complex fault geometry of the Himalayan main frontal thrust.
